[This Twilight Garden]
I lift my lips from kissing you
To kiss the sky
Cloud soft and blue
And slow the sun melts down
Into your golden words for me
I lift my hands from touching you
To touch the wind that whispers through
This twilight garden
Turns into a world
Where dreams are real
No-one will ever take your place
I am lost in you
No-one will ever take your place
So in love with you
I lift my eyes from watching you
To watch the star rise shine onto
Your dreaming face and dreaming smile
You're dreaming worlds for me
I lift my lips from kissing you
And kiss the sky wide deepest blue
And slow the moon swims up
Into your golden words for me
No-one will ever take your place
I am lost in you
No-one will ever take your place
So in love with you

Sometimes I think I'm gonna drown     | s vezes eu acho que vou me afogar
'Cause everyone around's so hollow    | Porque o mundo ao redor  to oco
I'm alone                             | Eu estou sozinho
Sometimes I think I'm going down      | s vezes eu acho que estou indo para baixo
But no one makes a sound              | Mas ningum faz um som
They follow                           | Eles seguem
And I'm alone                         | E eu estou sozinho
Yeah if I make it I'd be amazed       | Sim, se eu fizer isso eu ficaria espantado
Just to find tomorrow                 | Apenas para encontrar amanh
One more day and I'd be amazed        | Mais um dia e eu ficaria espantado
Just to see it waiting                | S para v-lo esperando
And if I make it I'm still alone      | E se eu fizer isso eu ainda estou sozinho
No more hope for better days          | No h mais esperana para dias melhores
But if I could change
Then I'd really be amazed
And when you know you can't relate
To one more shiny face
Your heart breaks
No one cares
And when you know you can't go on
'Cause everything is wrong
Your heart breaks
But no one's there

She's got a smile it seems to me          | Ela tem um sorriso que parece com o meu
Reminds me of childhood memories          | Lembra-me de memrias da infncia
Where everything
Was as fresh as the bright blue sky
Now and then when I see her face
She takes me away to that special place
And if I'd stare too long
I'd probably break down and cry
Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
She's got eyes of the bluest skies
As if they thought of rain
I hate to look into those eyes
And see an ounce of pain
Her hair reminds me of a warm safe place
Where as a child I'd hide
And pray for the thunder
And the rain
To quietly pass me by
Oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet love of mine
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sweet child o' mine
Oh,
Sweet love of mine
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Oh, oh
Where do we go?
Oh,
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Oh, (sweet child)
Where do we go now?
Oh,
Where do we go now?
Oh,
Where do we go?
Oh,
Where do we go now?
Oh,
Where do we go?
Where do we go now?
Where do we go?
Oh,
Where do we go now?
No, no, no, no, no, no
Sweet child,
Sweet child of mine
